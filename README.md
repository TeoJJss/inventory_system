To read data in a file, get every line of the file into an array, and split each element with "\t". Example code:  
```py
with open(file_dir, "r") as inventory_file:
    data_ls=inventory_file.readlines()
for ind, data in enumerate(data_ls):
    data_ls[ind]=data.rstrip().split("\t")
```

After getting all lines of data into an array, to call an element, call using the format `data_ls[row][column]` . Example:
```py
data_ls[0][1]
# To get 1st row 2nd column data
```
